1. Project Overview
This project delivers a real-time, filterable sales dashboard using Flask, Socket.IO, Pandas, and Chart.js. It provides managers and analysts an at-a-glance summary of sales performance with dynamic, responsive visualizations that update instantly as filters are applied or the data changes.

2. Problem Statement
Traditional static sales reports lack responsiveness and interactivity, making it hard for users to analyze up-to-date business metrics across regions, products, categories, and time periods. Businesses need a modern dashboard that enables dynamic filtering, real-time visual updates, and efficient, compact presentations of key sales metricsâ€”all in a visually engaging and accessible web interface.

3. Need for a Dynamic Dashboard
To allow end-users and analysts to view, filter, and explore sales data in real time.
To present diverse sales slices and trends quickly so that informed decisions can be made.
To provide a visually appealing and efficient dashboard that can run on typical business desktops.
